# SPAAACE
A simple 2d space ship shooter.

**This project is a work in progress**

Objective: to learn the ins and outs of python's pygame library,
           and learn how to go about dev'ing a game in general.

Being developed on Debian stretch/sid x64, several problems have arisen, with more dependancies than expected. See ./Dependancies for that list.
